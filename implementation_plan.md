# GovernAI Technical Design Document & Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
The objective is to build "GovernAI", a Streamlit-based AI Governance Platform MVP by Friday EOD. This internal tool will help organizations track their AI systems, classify their risk according to the EU AI Act, map compliance against frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF), monitor operational metrics (drift, bias, hallucination rate, cost), and provide audit-ready reporting. The core value proposition is the seamless integration between these modules: a system's risk tier dictates its compliance checklist, and breached monitoring metrics automatically degrade compliance status and trigger audit logs.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Architectural Decisions (Technical Depth)
* **PostgreSQL with UUID Primary Keys:** PostgreSQL was selected for better relational integrity, transactional consistency (ACID), stronger foreign key support, enterprise-grade database features, and multi-user scalability, aligning with real-world AI governance platforms. To enable the three developers to work and seed sample data independently without primary key collisions during Git merges, we are using UUIDs (stored as TEXT/UUID) rather than auto-incrementing integers.
* **Normalized Relational Schema over JSON Blobs:** Data sources, risk assessments, and compliance questionnaires are modeled as discrete relational tables. This prevents merge conflicts, enforces foreign key constraints, and ensures all fields are queryable for reporting.
* **Dynamic State Coupling ("The Golden Thread"):** Compliance status is not a static text field; it is dynamically calculated and updated by the backend. A threshold breach in the monitoring module automatically triggers state degradation in the AI Inventory and writes to the audit log.

### 2. MVP Scoping Decisions (Timeline & Demo Impact)
* **Session-Based Identity (vs. Full Authentication):** To meet the 3-day deadline, we are avoiding complex auth systems (OAuth/Firebase). Instead, we implement a sidebar role-selector (Admin, Compliance Officer, Engineer) to instantly simulate different user perspectives and generate realistic, role-attributed audit logs.
* **Simulation-First Ingestion (vs. CSV Upload):** A live demo is highly sensitive to input data. We prioritize a "Generate Breach Scenario" button to instantly trigger breaches and show the dynamic compliance update. CSV upload is relegated to a stretch feature.
* **Direct PDF Exports (via ReportLab):** Compliance audits require rigid, uneditable, and formatted evidence. We generate reports directly in PDF format (using ReportLab) rather than simple markdown or HTML exports to mimic real governance workflows.

## STEP 1: Requirement Analysis

**Business Objective:**
To provide organizations with a centralized internal tool to inventory their AI systems, assess their risk levels, manage framework-specific compliance, and monitor operational safety. This tool acts as the single source of truth for AI governance, specifically targeting the upcoming EU AI Act enforcement deadlines.

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **AI Inventory:** Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) AI systems (name, owner, purpose, model, data sources).
2. **Risk Classification:** Guided questionnaire to assign an EU AI Act risk tier (Prohibited, High-risk, Limited-risk, Minimal-risk).
3. **Compliance Mapping:** Generate compliance checklists based on risk tier covering EU AI Act and NIST frameworks. Calculate a completeness score. Show how single controls map to multiple frameworks.
4. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Ingest operational metrics (drift, bias, hallucination, cost) via CSV or simulation. Set and monitor thresholds.
5. **State Integration:** Automatically update compliance status to "Non-Compliant" or "At Risk" when thresholds are breached.
6. **Audit Trail:** Append-only logging of all state changes (status updates, threshold breaches, edits).
7. **Reporting:** Export audit-ready compliance reports for individual systems.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. **Tech Stack:** Streamlit (Frontend), PostgreSQL (Database), SQLAlchemy ORM (Data Access Layer), psycopg (Database Driver), Python (Backend).
2. **Data Integrity:** Shared, normalized PostgreSQL database acting as the single source of truth, enforcing referential integrity and transactional consistency (ACID).
3. **Delivery:** Functional end-to-end flow over disconnected polished screens. Seeded with realistic sample data.

**Assumptions & Ambiguities:**
- *Assumption:* A PostgreSQL database instance is available locally or hosted for the Streamlit application to connect to.
- *Assumption:* "Compliance Status" is a derived state (e.g., Compliant, Non-Compliant, At Risk) influenced by both manual checklist completion and automated monitoring metrics.
- *Ambiguity:* The exact questions for the risk questionnaire are not strictly defined; we will use standard representative EU AI Act criteria.

```

**Component Interaction & Data Flow:**
1. **User -> Frontend:** User interacts with Streamlit pages.
2. **Frontend -> Backend Services:** Streamlit calls modular Python functions (e.g., `update_system_status()`, `ingest_metrics()`).
3. **Backend -> Database:** Backend services perform SQLAlchemy ORM operations against PostgreSQL (utilizing the psycopg driver).
4. **Cross-Component Flow:** If the `Monitoring Engine` detects a metric breach, it emits an event/calls a function in the `CRUD Services` to update the AI System's status, which in turn calls the `Audit Logging Layer` to record the change.

---

## STEP 3: Database Design

The application uses PostgreSQL as the centralized relational database. SQLAlchemy ORM manages schema definitions and database interactions while psycopg provides PostgreSQL connectivity. All tables will use UUID primary keys to prevent ID collisions during parallel writes, and we avoid JSON blobs to ensure individual fields are queryable.

## STEP 5: Module Breakdown

**Module 1: AI System Inventory**
- **Responsibilities:** Central registry management.
- **UI Components:** Data table of all systems, forms for creating/editing, detailed view modal/page.
- **Backend Logic:** `ai_system_svc.py` handles input validation and DB insertion.
- **Database Interactions:** Reads/writes to `ai_systems`.

**Module 2: Risk Classification & Compliance**
- **Responsibilities:** Assess risk and map framework controls.
- **UI Components:** Step-by-step wizard for questionnaire. Checklist UI with checkboxes and evidence link text inputs. Progress bar for completeness score.
- **Backend Logic:** `risk_svc.py` evaluates answers to assign tiers. `compliance_svc.py` fetches the right controls based on tier and framework, calculates percentage of `is_met == True`. Shows cross-mapping (e.g., Control A satisfies both EU AI Act Art. 10 and NIST MAP 1.1).
- **Database Interactions:** Writes to `risk_assessments`, generates and updates rows in `compliance_records`.

**Module 3: Monitoring & Audit**
- **Responsibilities:** Track performance and maintain immutable history.
- **UI Components:** Line charts for drift/bias over time. CSV uploader / Simulate button. Audit log timeline view.
- **Backend Logic:** `monitoring_svc.py` compares new metric values against predefined thresholds. If breached, calls `ai_system_svc.py` to change status, which calls `audit_svc.py`.
- **Database Interactions:** Inserts into `monitoring_metrics`, updates `ai_systems.compliance_status`, inserts into `audit_logs`.

**Module 4: Reporting**
- **Responsibilities:** Generate auditor-ready artifacts.
- **UI Components:** "Export Report" button on the system detail view.
- **Backend Logic:** `report_gen.py` queries all tables for a specific `system_id`, formats them into a structured Markdown string, and provides it as a downloadable file.
- **Database Interactions:** Read-only queries across all tables.

---

## STEP 6: Integration Logic

**The Golden Thread (Data Lifecycle Flow):**
The true value of GovernAI is that data does not sit in silos. Here is how data flows through the application:

1. **System Created:** User creates "Meeting Scheduling Agent" (`agentic_trace_required=Yes`). DB creates `ai_systems` record. `audit_svc` logs `SYSTEM_CREATED`.
2. **Data Source Flagged:** User adds calendar/contacts data source. If `contains_pii = 1`, `risk_svc` reads this and auto-raises the suggested risk tier.
3. **Risk Classified:** User completes the risk questionnaire -> `risk_svc` assigns the tier. Individual answers are saved to `risk_classification_answers`. `audit_svc` logs `TIER_ASSIGNED`.
4. **Controls Generated:** `compliance_svc` automatically seeds `compliance_records` with EU AI Act obligations (e.g., Human Oversight) and maps them to NIST based on the risk tier.
5. **Agent Runs (Simulated):** The agent performs three steps (e.g., read email, check calendar, book meeting). Each step is logged to `agent_action_trace` linked under one parent `audit_logs` row.
6. **The Cross-Wiring Trigger:** User simulates a metric breach (e.g., Cost > $100). `monitoring_svc` detects the breach and executes an atomic backend flow:
   - Saves the metric in `monitoring_metrics` with `is_breached = True`.
   - Calls `ai_system_svc.update_status(system_id, "Non-Compliant")`.
   - Calls `audit_svc.log_action("METRIC_BREACH", "Cost exceeded $100. Status changed to Non-Compliant")`.
7. **Report Exported:** User clicks "Export Report". `report_gen` compiles the system details, PII evidence from `data_sources`, the completeness score, the breach alert, and the full audit trail (including the step-by-step agent trace) into a single PDF document.

## STEP 7: Team Distribution (Assuming 3 Developers)

*Total Duration: Wednesday - Friday (3-Day Compressed Timeline).*

- **Developer 1 (Data & Core Backend):**
  - Setup PostgreSQL connection (`db.py`), define SQLAlchemy models (`models.py`), and initialize schema (`init_db.py`).
  - Create the `seed_data.py` script with the following realistic sample systems:
    - **Resume Screening AI** (High Risk, LLM)
    - **Loan Approval AI** (High Risk, Classical ML)
    - **Customer Support Assistant** (Limited Risk, LLM)
    - **Meeting Scheduling Agent** (Moderate Risk / Agentic AI)
  - Build `ai_system_svc.py` and `audit_svc.py`.
  - Build the main `app.py` scaffolding and Inventory UI (`2_Inventory.py`).

- **Developer 2 (Risk & Compliance):**
  - Design the Risk Questionnaire logic (`risk_svc.py`).
  - Define the framework mappings (EU AI Act & NIST) in `config/settings.py`.
  - Build `compliance_svc.py` and the respective UIs (`3_Risk_Setup.py`, `4_Compliance.py`).

- **Developer 3 (Monitoring & Reporting):**
  - Build the metrics ingestion and threshold checking logic (`monitoring_svc.py`).
  - Develop the charts and dashboards (`5_Monitoring.py`, `1_Dashboard.py`).
  - Build the `report_gen.py` functionality.

- **Integration Responsibilities (All Hands - Thursday):**
  - Ensure `monitoring_svc` correctly triggers the status updates managed by Dev 1.
  - Ensure Dev 2's risk tiers correctly seed Dev 1's system records.
  - Pair program the "Golden Thread" walkthrough to ensure a flawless demo.

**Suggested Timeline (3-Day Sprint):**
- **Wednesday (Foundation & Core Setup):**
  - Complete shared data model agreement, database setup/initialization (`db.py`, `models.py`, `init_db.py`), and seeding of sample systems (`seed_data.py`).
  - Scaffolding of the multi-page Streamlit application (`app.py`, `1_Dashboard.py`, `2_Inventory.py`).
  - Implement risk engine logic and UI questionnaire (`risk_svc.py`, `3_Risk_Setup.py`).
- **Thursday (Compliance, Monitoring & Integration):**
  - Implement compliance framework mappings and checklists (`compliance_svc.py`, `4_Compliance.py`).
  - Build operational metrics ingestion/simulation and threshold triggers (`monitoring_svc.py`, `5_Monitoring.py`).
  - Implement "The Golden Thread" integration: automate status degradation and append-only audit logging upon threshold breach.
- **Friday (Reporting, Polish & Walkthrough):**
  - Complete PDF report generation backend (`report_gen.py`) and UI export trigger.
  - Final UI polishing (applying custom CSS, glassmorphism, responsive adjustments).
  - Walkthrough verification, end-to-end testing, and demo rehearsal.

---

## STEP 8: MVP Roadmap

**Must Have (MVP for Friday):**
- Shared PostgreSQL data model (The Foundation).
- System inventory (View/Add).
- Risk questionnaire mapping to EU AI Act tiers.
- Compliance checklist with completeness score.
- Metric ingestion with threshold triggers.
- Automated compliance status degradation on breach.
- Append-only audit log.
- Direct PDF report export (via ReportLab).

**Good to Have (If time permits Thursday/Friday):**
- Real CSV upload for metrics (instead of just simulation).
- Visual time-series charts for monitoring metrics.
- High-level portfolio dashboard showing total compliant vs non-compliant systems.

**Stretch Features (Post-MVP):**
- LLM-powered assistant recommending risk tiers based on a plain-language system description.
- Role-based views (Engineer sees metrics, Compliance Officer sees checklists).
